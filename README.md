# Hello, I'm Radosevic Dejan! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a passionate learner and practitioner at the intersection of **Full Stack Development** and **Ethical Hacking**. With a background as unique as mine, I've transitioned from being a physical security specialistâ€”where I was securing premises in the physical worldâ€”to now fortifying the digital frontier. It's safe to say, I've got security covered from all angles!

## ðŸ’» Tech Stack
- **Love to Work With:** ReactJS, NextJS, Astro, Angular (*still learning ðŸ¤«*), Sanity
- **Currently Learning:** PHP, Laravel, SQL (with a focus on MySQL and PostgreSQL)
- **Familiar With:** Python (*though I could use a quick refresher*)
- **Interests:** Full Stack Development, Ethical Hacking, Knitting (*I'm joking with you ðŸ¤£*)
- **Invested time to get familiar with and unfortunately never used:** Django, Go, C++, 

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
I'm on a journey to deepen my understanding of backend technologies, specifically PHP and SQL. My goal is to become proficient in creating secure and efficient database-driven applications.

## ðŸ˜„ Fun Fact
As a former physical security specialist, I used to protect assets and individuals by standing guard and being vigilant. Now, in the realm of coding, I stand guard over lines of code, protecting against vulnerabilities. It's all about finding the right key, both in locks and in code!
